# WordPress Hooks Intellisense for VS Code

This extension provides intellisense and autocomplete for WordPress hooks, actions, and filters.

* Autocomplete for action and filter names
* Autocomplete for action and filter callback functions
* "Go to Definition" support for action and filter callback functions
* Hover information on action and filter names

Last updated for WordPress 5.5 (August 2020).

## Usage

Start typing the name of a WordPress action or filter within `add_action()` or `add_filter()` and you'll get an autocomplete list of all matching actions or filters, plus information about the parameters and usage:

Autocomplete is also provided for the callback function. It's contextually aware and provides options for a function, a class method, a closure, an arrow function, and WordPress' built-in utility functions:

An autocompleted closure callback looks like this:

Parameter types, the return type, and a docblock are included where appropriate. The behaviour of these can be adjusted in the settings for the extension.

## FAQ

### Which functions does the autocomplete list work with?

* `add_action()`
* `add_filter()`
* `remove_action()`
* `remove_filter()`
* `has_action()`
* `has_filter()`
* `doing_action()`
* `doing_filter()`
* `did_action()`

### How can I trigger the autocomplete list if it doesn't show up?

Place your cursor within the first parameter of one of the supported functions, eg `add_action()` or `add_filter()`, and hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd>. This works with any autocomplete provider, not only this extension.

### Can I disable or adjust the type declarations / type hints / docblock?

Yes, open the preferences for VS Code and go to the **Extensions -> WordPress Hooks Intellisense** section.

### Where does the list of hook names come from?

They're generated directly from the WordPress core software and updated in time for each new release. They're bundled with this extension so there's no requirement for your project to include WordPress if you don't want to, and the extension doesn't scan the files in your project looking for actions and filters.
